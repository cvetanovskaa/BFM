# The 'static' directory

In this directory should be content that is served "as-is". This is typically:

* CSS (like Bootstrap)
* Javascript files (like JQuery)
* Documents (like Word docs, PDFs, etc.)

Anything that you want served to the world without being rendered or modified
in some way should end up in the static directory.
